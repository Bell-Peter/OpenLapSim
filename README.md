# OpenLapSim
The Open Source Lap Time Simulation Software

## QUICK START

### Intro
The OpenLapSim is a quasi-static Lap Time Simulator for a point mass
vehicle, with aerodynamics forces, engine map, gear ratio and tire friction
ellipse, written in Python.  
The program simulates the maximum performance (accelerations) of the
given vehicle-setup on all the sections of the circuit, giving the fastest lap
time and highest speed trace over the lap the car could theoretically perform.

### Run a Sim
To run a simulation and see the results just run the file "RunOpenLapSim.py" on /src repository.

### More Info
For more details on the software read the "OpenLapSim_Doc.pdf" in the /docs repository.
